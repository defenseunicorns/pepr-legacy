# Monitoring

In order for an application to be integrated with the monitoring stack within BigBang the following things need to occur


1. Identify the pods that have metrics endpoints via:
    1. This can be done with the Prometheus annotations defined below:

        `proetheus.io/scrape` <- Set to true

        `prometheus.io/schema` <- either http(default) or https

        `prometheus.io/path` <- the path that schould be scraped

        `prometheus.io/port` <-- The port to scrape
    1. This can be done with `ServiceMonitors`, `PodMonitors`
1. Create a NetworkPolicy that allows communication from the Prometheus Pods in the Monitoring namespace to talk to the pods with metrics
1. Find and identify Grafana Dashboards for the application and inject them into Grafana


## Implementation

Proposed implementation, to start, is to create Kyverno policies to create a `NetworkPolicies` for each:
    
1. pod with the appropriate annotation
2. ServiceMonitor
3. PodMonitor 

When Istio is enabled, will also need additional considerations for [mTLS settings](https://docs-bigbang.dso.mil/latest/packages/monitoring/docs/istio-mtls-metrics/)
